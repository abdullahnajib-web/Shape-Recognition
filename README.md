# Shape Recognition


This program is specifically designed for real-time recognition of geometric shapes, such as triangles, rectangles, and more, using ESP32CAM and UDP for efficient data transmission. The ESP32CAM captures images from its surroundings and processes them to identify these geometric shapes. The recognition results, including the detected shapes and their respective properties, are transmitted via UDP to an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 then receives and interprets this shape data and displays it on a dedicated display screen. This integrated system showcases the potential of combining geometric shape recognition with ESP32CAM, real-time communication with UDP, and visual display on ESP32 for applications that require accurate shape identification and visual representation.
